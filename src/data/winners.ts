        title: "Alpha-Synuclein Inhibitors: Emerging Platform for Parkinson's Disease Therapy",
        abstract: `Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurological disorder that affects nearly 60,000 Americans each year [20]. Major complaints from PD patients include painful aching from muscles, impaired balance, tremors, and bradykinesia. Although the illness remains incurable, several treatments such as levodopa and monoamine oxidase B-inhibitors were developed to help relieve the symptoms; however, these medications have had substantial setbacks. Current treatments failed to improve the symptoms over time and have been associated with life-threatening side effects including liver failure. The understanding of the etiology of PD has tremendously increased and, interestingly, overwhelming evidence indicates that the gene encoding for alpha-synuclein—SNCA— is a primary gene associated with PD. It was discovered that the toxic species triggering neuronal cell death appear to be early "soluble oligomers”. Thus, inhibiting a-Syn oligomerization via modified peptide inhibitors would be a viable approach, as the inhibitors have shown to impede a-Syn assembly into early oligomers.`

        title: "A Novel Lateral Flow Immunoassay for the Detection of Parvovirus B19 in Urine",
        abstract: `Parvovirus B19, a respiratory virus known for causing fifth disease (an illness in which a rash appears across the cheeks), poses a primary threat to individuals with immunocompromising disorders and blood diseases (Bamidele, n.d.). Despite a prevalence of 85% of individuals 70 years or older in developed countries contracting Parvovirus B19, testing for Parvovirus B19 continues to be inaccessible to low-income households and expensive (Parvoviruses - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, n.d.). Current testing for Parvovirus B19 comprises blood testing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which are time-consuming and prone to inaccuracy (High-Sensitivity PCR Detection of Parvovirus B19 in Plasma, n.d.). To address the shortcomings of modern diagnostic tests for Parvovirus B19, I propose the development of a lateral flow immunoassay specified to urine analyte utilizing antibody MAb 8293 in order to detect the viral protein two (VP2) capsid protein distinct to the Parvovirus B19 antigen.`

        title: "Examining Whether The Use Of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) Nanoparticles Are Effective In Reducing The Severity Of Congenital Autophagic Vacuolar Myopathy (CAVM)",
        abstract: `Due to the rarity of autophagic vacuolar myopathy (AVM) disorders, the group of diseases are often overlooked in scientific research. The AVM disorders are a cluster of ailments that include genetic disorders, such as congenital autophagic vacuolar myopathy and XMEA, both of which are allelic and share similar pathological characteristics when examined through muscle biopsy. Despite the two diseases' similarities, XMEA has a more favorable prognosis than CAVM, due to a slight variation in the genetic mutations present in both conditions. The genetic change in CAVM leads to the upregulation of lysosomal pH levels, which then hinders autophagosomes in cells, and eventually progresses to the disease-pathognomonic large autophagic vacuoles seen in the disorder. Therefore, compounds such as the polyester, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), that regulate lysosomal pH, could ultimately have a therapeutic role in converting patients with CAVM to the much more benign XMEA, if not entirely back to health.`

          abstract: `Brain diseases and disorders are devastating at an individual level and impaired mental health is an important issue for addressing societal well-being. Although the brain is of central issue to human health it is an extremely difficult organ to study and treat. For therapeutic applications in particular, the special blood brain barrier (BBB) presents a challenging obstacle. The absence of BBB tissue models severely limits central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery and disease modeling. Current In vivo animal models are expensive and hampered by complex, multi-cellular interactions that are difficult to decouple. To address these limitations, I propose to develop a 3D tissue model of the BBB using a tissue engineering technology that enables the 4 main brain cell types to be assembled in an architecture that is relevant for drug discovery and disease modeling of the human brain.`

          abstract: `Oil pollution in oceans is a major threat to coastal shores, groundwater supplies, and most importantly, the health of marine life and humans. As natural degradation is slow and anthropogenic catalysts are environmentally unsafe or ineffective, researchers have been looking towards bioremediation, which uses natural oil-eating microorganisms to reduce the amount of oil. It has been shown that this process can also be sped up through the use of fertilizers with nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur and calcium. This proposed experiment will examine the effectiveness (measured as the number of oil-eating microorganisms present in the samples after every 2 weeks) of such fertilizers compared to that of an agar-based version, which will use agar in addition to the aforementioned nutrients as a binding agent, allowing nutrients to be slowly released and preventing excess algae growth.`

          title: "On the Use of a Mediatorless Microbial Fuel Cell for the Eradication of MethylMercury Ions in Marine Food Webs",
          abstract: `Impaired mental functioning, hindered growth, cerebral palsy, and weakened respiration in humans and marine organisms have each been attributed to the Pacific Ocean’s growing sink of MethylMercury ions. When fossil fuels are burned, forest fires ensue, and mass manufacturing occurs, Mercury filtrates into bodies of water until anaerobic microorganisms convert bioavailable, inorganic Mercury into MethylMercury ions through methylation. MethylMercury, a neurotoxin, biomagnifies (increases in concentration within the tissues of animals) as the marine and freshwater food chains progress; hence, the secondary consumers and apex predators have the largest concentrations of MethylMercury, and -as a result- the increased likelihood of adverse reproductive and neurodevelopmental effects. The mass decline of seafood in domestic water supplies and legal suits stemming from acute or chronic mercury poisoning has not solely been borne by seafood cultivators, but by indigenous communities globally as well. To eradicate the concentration of MethylMercury ions in marine food webs, the novel mechanism of microbial fuel cells with respiring microbes can be utilized to convert the MethylMercury ions into electrical energy, whilst filtrating metal remnants towards abiotic cathodes. In the cell, chemical bonds in MethylMercury (which poses as a substrate feed) are converted to electrical energy through catalytic reactions of microorganisms under anaerobic (without oxygen) conditions in an anode chamber. Thus, simultaneously removing pollutants whilst generating renewable energy. Under neutral pH conditions, utilization of graphite felt on the anode, and carbon paper on the cathode, a maximum removal efficiency of 99.54% is expected based on rates of mediated mercury contaminants.`

            title: "Fecal Coliform and Microbial Life as Bioindicators of Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms",
            abstract: `Although the phrase “algal bloom” generally evokes benign pond scum, Harmful Algal Blooms pose significant dangers to humans and wildlife. Every year, spikes in toxic algal growth cause hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and poison ecosystems and economies across the globe. Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (cyanoHABs) cause anoxic conditions that suffocate aquatic life and secrete hazardous amounts of cyanotoxins that bioaccumulate in species of seafood like shellfish. Despite afflicting every coastal region in the United States and most waterbodies on Earth, accurate bloom prediction is difficult without expensive equipment such as satellites and buoys. Existing mathematical models are often inaccurate as models fail to account for biotic factors like microbe-cyanobacterial relationships, which have rarely been studied. Evaluating fecal coliform as a novel bioindicator for cyanoHABs and exploring whether bacterial populations can improve freshwater cyanoHAB forecasting models will contribute to overcoming accessibility, accuracy, and affordability issues posed by current forecasting models.`

            abstract: `Plastic pollution in bodies of water is an acute issue in Indonesia, because it threatens wildlife and human health. Present solutions fail to address the longevity of plastic pollution and are temporary fixes at best. In light of this situation, this proposal propounds the development of powderized biological agents to clean Indonesia’s rivers. More specifically, it explores using semi-rational design to engineer a stronger binding affinity in the recently discovered PETase in Ideonella sakaiensis, an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing PET, as well as the application of laboratory adaptive evolution in Exiguobacterium, to enhance metabolic preference for polystyrene as a carbon source. These evolved strains will undergo a spray-drying process to produce a powder-based product that can be released into waterways using a chemical dosing pump. Collectively, this technology would enable the digestion of polystyrene and PET in bodies of water, thereby reducing plastic pollution through non-palliative means.`

            abstract: `Unable to create insulin, diabetics rely on insulin delivery to allow glucose to enter cells. Current expensive and inconvenient delivery methods incur large social and economic expenses. Over 1.4 million diabetics are diagnosed in the US annually, partly due to insufficient prediabetes testing. This lack of efficacy of insulin delivery management in Type 1 and select Type 2 diabetic patients calls for improvements in insulin release methods and blood glucose level testing. Current technologies for abnormal blood sugar detection and control are inconvenient and pain-inducing, involving needles and catheters. We propose Microneedle Glucose Control, a painless, practical microneedle technology that improves insulin delivery and blood glucose monitoring through one device, useful for the prevention of prediabetes as well as early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. We aim to improve diabetic patients’ quality of life by developing a hollow microneedle patch, replacing painful and inconvenient treatment.`

            abstract: `The mitochondrion is most notably known as the powerhouse of the cell, but malfunctions of this organelle have underscored its importance in a myriad of aspects. Mitochondrial disease has been linked to cancer, aging, and neurodegenerative illnesses, like dementia. Replacement of the mitochondrion and its genetic material has been the basis of mitochondrial therapy, but studies replacing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have displayed reversion to parental mtDNA. Little is known about the mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon, with it possibly occurring exclusively in humans. Consequently, the transfer of whole mitochondria appears a more viable option: it’s proven to be successfully moved between cells. However, the current methods for horizontal transfer have failed to address maintaining mitochondrial quality, preserving function over longer periods of time, and the conflicting results of uptake. Contrastly, centrifugation has demonstrated to be a simpler and efficient method for mitochondrial transfer and capable of preserving quality over longer periods.`

            abstract: `(Poly)ethylene terephthalate (PET), a plastic used in disposable water bottles, significantly contributes to ocean pollution. An engineered strain of Bacillus tianshenii , a gram-positive, spore-forming, halotolerant bacteria, which would contain the gene for plastic-degrading enzyme PETase, can be utilized for the bioremediation of PET. The bacteria, in their inactive spore form, would be placed alongside dried nutrients underneath a full-length water bottle label. Upon exposure to the high salinity conditions of the ocean, the bacteria would germinate and produce PETase, degrading the bottle and label. Due to limitations of a high school laboratory, proof of concept experiments will be conducted without transforming Bacillus . Producing PETase and Leaf Compost Cutinase, another plastic degrading enzyme, via a cell-free system or expression in E. coli would allow for their use in functional assays to measure the degradation ability of each enzyme on various plastic substrates under differing conditions of temperature and salinity.`

            abstract: `Organ preservation is necessary to maintain organ stability during storage so that at reperfusion where the organ is surgically placed in the recipient, the organ functions. In modern day heart transplant preservation, hypothermic storage is implemented where, once removed from the donor, hearts are cooled to and kept at temperature a few degrees above the freezing point until they reach the recipient. However, clinical research from Massachusetts General hospital states that about three out of four donated hearts have to be discarded due to short preservation life. We propose a solution that aims to address this issue and extend the preservation life of heart transplants. Our proposal is to implement a preservation solution composed of cryoprotectants of great potency, little toxicity, and high stability, and to rapidly freeze heart transplants to around -196°C through vitrification.`
