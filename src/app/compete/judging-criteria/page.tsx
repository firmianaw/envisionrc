          Judging Criteria
        </p>
        <p className="pb-2">
          Judges will review the proposal in four categories. All four categories are weighted equally and scored to the tenth as a value out of 9. An entry&apos;s final score will be an average of the scores given by several judges.
        </p>
        <p className="text-2xl font-bold pt-4 pb-2">
          1. Significance
        </p>
        <p className="pb-2">
          The contestant&apos;s proposal either aims to solve a small inconvenience that affects a large population or a problem with a large impact that affects a small population. Literature which supports the significance of the problem is cited.
        </p>
        <p className="text-2xl font-bold pt-4 pb-2">
          2. Feasibility
        </p>
        <p className="pb-2">
          The contestant&apos;s interpretation of all pre-existing technology, methods, and concepts she describes in the proposal are correct. If the contestant can take all the steps, the study will succeed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-2xl font-bold pt-4 pb-2">
          3. Innovation
        </p>
        <p className="pb-2">
          How novel and creative is the proposal idea? Is it different from pre-existing concepts?
        </p>
        <p className="text-2xl font-bold pt-4 pb-2">
          4. Approach
        </p>
        <p className="pb-2">
          The funding, time, and resources the proposal asks for are justified by the breadth of the potential impact. In other words, the proposal uses the most avant-garde, efficient, and effective methods available to accomplish the goal. (Because this is a high school level competition, students are not required to include a budget in their proposal.)

          To promote transparency, after judging, all participants will be able to see their rubrics and receive direct feedback from their judges.
